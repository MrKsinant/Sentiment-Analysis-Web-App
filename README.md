# Sentiment Analysis Web App

This study corresponds to the fifth, and last, project of the nanodegree *Deep Learning*, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to build a **sentiment analysis web app** for movie reviews, based on existing IMDb reviews dataset, thanks to **AWS** (https://aws.amazon.com) SageMaker and, too, other services proposed by the cloud computing provider.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***sentiment-analysis-web-app.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The folder *assets*, which contains the images used to illustrate the study;
* The folder *website*, which contains the simple and basic HTML file which acts here as a web app;
* The folder *train*, which contains the files used by SageMaker to train the RNN used for this project;
* The folder *serve*, which contains the files used by SageMaker to used in the web app the model built during the training phase.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to **PyTorch** (https://pytorch.org), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by **Facebook** and its **FAIR** (Facebook AI Research) team (https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/).
