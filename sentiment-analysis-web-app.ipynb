    "In this project, thanks to **SageMaker** and **PyTorch**, we are going construct a basic (but functional) **Sentiment Analysis Web App** from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review; the web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.\n",

    "## General Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this project, we can recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download or otherwise retrieve the data;\n",
    "2. Process / Prepare the data;\n",
    "3. Upload the processed data to S3;\n",
    "4. Train a chosen model;\n",
    "5. Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job);\n",
    "6. Deploy the trained model;\n",
    "7. Use the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we will not be testing the model in its own step: We will do it by deploying our model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that we can make sure that our deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will deploy and use our trained model a second time: In this second iteration, we will customize the way that our trained model is deployed by including some of our own code. In addition, our newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will be using the [IMDb dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).\n",

Sure it has some extremes.. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. I am not a big fan of traditional music either but I wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film.<br /><br />If someone told me to say something against this film I'd define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. I guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres..<br /><br />Anyway I could write more and more to express my thought over this but I guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend.

These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.\n",

It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving."

Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.\n",

This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nota Bene:* When the built-in inference code is run, it must import the `model_fn()` function from the `train.py` file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard (i.e. `if __name__ == '__main__':`). Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nota Bene:* When deploying a model, we are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until **we** shut it down: This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for, in other words, **If we are no longer using a deployed endpoint, we must shut it down!**\n",
